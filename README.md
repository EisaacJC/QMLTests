# QMLTests
QML Tests, in particular Main_Test is an script designed to test how well sampler from Qiskit behaves when feature map or ansatz proposal are disturbed with a random configuration of quantum gates with a random probability between 0-1, this corresponds to an arbitrary change that oscillates between 0-15% in each direction, since the parameters are well determined from [0 ,$\pi$ ]
